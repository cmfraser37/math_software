Old math research code I wrote to support the papers "Braid group symmetries of Grassmannian cluster algebras,"  "Quantum affine algebras and Grassmannians", and "Tensor diagrams and cluster combinatorics at punctures." All code is written in SAGE (and designed to run with Python 2). 

The code is here so potential employers can look at the kind of code I was writing to do my math research. 

The code is sparsely documented and written early in my journey with Python, so it might be a tough read for others. Hopefully I can clean things up at a later date.

Probably the most useful things to other mathematicians would be the weakly separated collection class and tableaux cluster mutation class. At the moment, there is no SAGE implementation of plabic graphs etc.
